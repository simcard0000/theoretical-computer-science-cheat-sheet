Sandy,

Here's a quick reference `cheat' sheet for theory people
which I've been working on. It has most of those formulas
which I always forget and have to look up in books, notes,
etc....

Most of the material is out of Concrete Mathematics,
but not all of it. Some of it is just amusing. I'm sure that
there are still typos in it.

It's all done in TeX, except for one postscript picture.
It needs to print on a PostScript printer. I can send you
the TeX source if you want, but it's messy.

If you find it useful, or spot any typos, or have suggestions
for additions, let me know. I don't really want to distribute
it widely until most of the errors are found.

Steve

PS. Of course I should really be working on research, but when
I get bored or stuck, this gives me something constructive to do.
Actually, I learned a lot just making this sheet up.
