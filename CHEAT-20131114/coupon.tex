Analysis of ``coupon collector'':
Suppose we are given a random coupon each day,
and that there are $n$ different types of coupons.
Further,
the distribution of coupons is uniform.
How many days pass before we expect to collect all $n$ types?
Let $Y_i$ be the number of days to see a new type,
given $i$ types have been seen.
The answer will be $$\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \E[Y_i].$$
Let $p = (n-i)/n$.
$Y_i$ is geometrically distributed,
and so
$$ \E[Y_i] = \sum^\infty_{k=1} kpq^{k-1} = {n \over n-i}.$$
The answer is therefore
$$ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} {n \over n-i} = n \sum_{i=1}^{n} {1 \over i} = n H_n.$$
